In this Machine Learning project, I have worked with the French Motor Claims dataset.
I have used Pyspark API for this vast dataset
The aim of the project is to predict the claims for a given vehicle description using Poisson regression, L1 & L2-Reguliarized Linear regression and L1 & L2-Reguliarized Logistic regression.
